# Contributing to Jammming
Thanks for having an interest in contributing, however since it's a [Codecademy](https://www.Codecademy.com) Practice Project, the only contributions I'm accepting are Bug reports.

## Issue submissions
If you encounter any problems, the best way you can highlight it is to [create an issue](https://github.com/SweetBoy13735/Jammming/issues).

1. Please prefix your title with "**BUG REPORT:** ", leading on with the bug at hand.
2. Dive into further detail of what happened in the description. If possible, please include console outputs and/or steps to reproduce the bug.
