This is a [Codecademy](https://www.Codecademy.com) Practice Project; a [React](https://React.dev) app that allows users to query the [Spotify](https://www.Spotify.com) library, create a playlist, then save it to their account.

## Support
If you encounter any problems, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/SweetBoy13735/Jammming/issues) (Provided it hasn't been logged already).

## Roadmap
This portfolio uses the [Git Flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hFtoPgwf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/wo935eqxtakkfylqzn7y.png) branching method to keep track of progress.

Once complete, I don't intend to re-visit this project unless there's bugs to fix, or I've forgotten how to build React apps ðŸ˜‚.
